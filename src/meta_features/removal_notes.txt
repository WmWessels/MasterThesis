914, 919, 924 -> Single features, not informative enough and leads to problems with meta feature calculation
4133, 42260 -> OpenML does not yield a y column, cannot calculate entropy & class features.
larger set is removed because of memory problems. Decided to remove data sets with Nr instances > 500000, Nr features > 2500 or where Nr. instances * Nr. features > 10_000_000
